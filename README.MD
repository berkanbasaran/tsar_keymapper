## ⚠️ Important Notice
This resource is currently a **proof of concept** and is not intended for production use. It demonstrates the possibility of capturing keyboard inputs in RedM using NUI (New User Interface) but requires further development for stable functionality.

## 📝 Description
TSAR's Keymapper is an experimental resource that showcases the potential for comprehensive key mapping in RedM. It utilizes NUI to capture keyboard events, providing a foundation for future key mapping implementations.

## 🔍 Features
- Demonstrates keyboard event capture through NUI
- Proof of concept for key mapping in RedM
- Basic framework for future key mapping systems

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- Uses NUI for key event capture
- Written in JavaScript
- Compatible with RedM's prerelease build

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Copy the `tsar_keymapper` folder to your server's resources directory
2. Add `ensure tsar_keymapper` to your `server.cfg`

## ⚡ Current Limitations
- This is a proof of concept only
- Not suitable for production environments
- May have inconsistent behavior
- Requires further development for stable functionality

## 🔮 Future Development
- Implement stable key mapping system
- Add configuration options
- Improve reliability and performance
- Add proper error handling
